# Ubrary

Brian Martinez / February 26, 2018 

## Ubrary Proposal  
	- "Read the good books first, or you may not have a chance to read them at all." - Henry Thoreau
	- Ubrary is my attempt at making a simple and more user friendly "Goodreads". 
	- A user will theoretically be able to sign in and is brought to his/her list of books they want to read.
	- Once there they will be able to move books from the "want to read" list to "already read" list or "favorites". 
	- Either list a user will be able to upload their own "UReview"
		- rate the book from 1 to 5 stars. 
    	- Log quotes and passages from the book.
		- Write summary of the book.
		- Edit their UReview
	- From the main booklist the user has the option of deleting a book from their list they no longer want to read.
