# Ubrary

Brian Martinez / February 26, 2018 

## Ubrary Proposal  
	- "Read the good books first, or you may not have a chance to read them at all." - Henry Thoreau
	- Ubrary is my attempt at making a simple and more user friendly "Goodreads". 
	- A user will theoretically be able to sign in and is brought to his/her list of books they want to read.
	- Once there they will be able to move books from the "want to read" list to "already read" list or "favorites". 
	- Either list a user will be able to upload their own "UReview"
		- rate the book from 1 to 5 stars. 
    	- Log quotes and passages from the book.
		- Write summary of the book.
		- Edit their UReview
	- From the main booklist the user has the option of deleting a book from their list they no longer want to read.

## User Stories  
    - [User stories](http://www.mariaemerson.com/user-stories/) that describe how your app will be used.

## Technology
	- Goodreads API 
	  The Goodreads API allows developers access to Goodreads data in order to help websites or applications that deal with books be more personalized, social, and engaging. The API can be used in many ways, including:

	  https://www.goodreads.com/api/

	- UglifyJS – a JavaScript parser/compressor/beautifier

	  On the web, performance is everything. The more performance we can squeeze out, the faster our websites and apps are going to be. Saving even a little bit of space and load-times can have a huge impact on your overall business performance, giants like Google have long talked about shaving off as much trim as possible, as even a millisecond of performance increase can mean more business. UglifyJS2 trims and minifies your JavaScript files for you automatically. It’s flexible, easy to use, and helps you to gain those performance margins that you seek.

    - Possibly would like to explore different templating engines. 
    - features features features if time and developer sanity/skill up to par
